  <p>A great story about a young man trying to figure his life out. He has a great support system in friends and
    therapist.

  <img src="/images/rounders.jpeg" alt="">
  <p>I enjoy playing poker and this has been one of those films that the actors are so believable that I actually feel
    some type of way towards the characters themselves.</p>
